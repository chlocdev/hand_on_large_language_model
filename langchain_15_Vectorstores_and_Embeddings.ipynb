       "Document(page_content='MachineLearning-Lecture01  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):  Okay. Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \\nlearning class. So what I wanna do today is ju st spend a little time going over the logistics \\nof the class, and then we\\'ll start to  talk a bit about machine learning.  \\nBy way of introduction, my name\\'s  Andrew Ng and I\\'ll be instru ctor for this class. And so \\nI personally work in machine learning, and I\\' ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\nI actually think that machine learning is th e most exciting field of all the computer \\nsciences. So I\\'m actually always excited about  teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thin g in computer science, but \\nthe most exciting thing in all of human e ndeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\nrelated to the machine learni ng and all aspects of machin e learning. Paul Baumstarck \\nworks in machine learning and computer vision.  Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \\nwho applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \\nis another PhD student, works in computa tional biology and in sort of the basic \\nfundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is  the head TA — he\\'s head TA two years \\nin a row now — works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots. And \\nDaniel Ramage is — I guess he\\'s not here  — Daniel applies l earning algorithms to \\nproblems in natural language processing.  \\nSo you\\'ll get to know the TAs and me much be tter throughout this quarter, but just from \\nthe sorts of things the TA\\'s do, I hope you can  already tell that machine learning is a \\nhighly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find l earning algorithms to problems \\nin computer vision and biology and robots a nd language. And machine learning is one of \\nthose things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \\nSo just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \\nhelicopter pilots to biologists to people in  computer systems or databases to economists \\nand sort of also an unending stream of  people from industry coming to Stanford \\ninterested in applying machine learni ng methods to their own problems.  \\nSo yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwar ded to me an article \\nin \"Computer World\" about the 12 IT skills th at employers can\\'t say no to. So it\\'s about \\nsort of the 12 most desirabl e skills in all of IT and all of information technology, and \\ntopping the list was actually machine lear ning. So I think this is a good time to be \\nlearning this stuff and learning algorithms and having a large impact on many segments \\nof science and industry.  \\nI\\'m actually curious about something. Learni ng algorithms is one of the things that \\ntouches many areas of science and industrie s, and I\\'m just kind of curious. How many \\npeople here are computer science majors, are in the computer science department? Okay. \\nAbout half of you. How many people are from  EE? Oh, okay, maybe about a fifth.
